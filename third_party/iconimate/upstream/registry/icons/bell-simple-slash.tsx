// SILENCED — the bell rings freely, then the slash sweeps across and the swing dies as it
// lands. The mute is something that HAPPENS rather than a starting state, which is the whole
// reason to animate a slash icon at all: the two swings after the slash completes are a
// fraction of the two before it. The ring itself is the same spine shipping in bell.tsx, so
// the muted bell stays a sibling of the live one.
//
// THE SLASH CANNOT BE LIFTED OUT OF THE SOURCE, so this rebuilds instead of decomposing.
// Phosphor does not overlay a slash on a whole bell — it REDRAWS the bell with the dome's
// upper-left and the collar's right omitted where the slash crosses, so the outline stops
// against the slash rather than passing behind it. Two approaches were tried and abandoned:
//   · overlaying a slash on the whole bell is wrong by 832 pixels, and no clearance band
//     recovers it (sweeping widths 16..44 bottoms out at 849, against 851);
//   · masking the slash band out of the source and redrawing it does round-trip, but a
//     static cut leaves the bell carrying Phosphor's gaps as a ghost outline before the ink
//     arrives, and making the cut follow the stroke is worse still — the source's own slash
//     then stays visible ahead of it, so the slash looks fully drawn from the first frame.
// So the bell is drawn from bell-simple's own whole geometry and the slash is simply stroked
// over it, running continuously beneath rather than stopping against it.
//
// THE TRADE IS 12,447 PIXELS — 5.9% of the glyph's ink. That counts only pixels which flip
// ink/no-ink, so antialiasing cannot inflate it: 12,447 drawn here but absent from the source,
// and 10 the other way. An earlier revision of this comment claimed "832 pixels (1.3%)", which
// was a narrower measurement stated as if it were the rest-state deviation and understated it
// by roughly fifteen times. Almost all of the real figure is CLEARANCE — Phosphor leaves white
// margins on both sides of the slash where it crosses the outline, and here the outline
// touches it instead, so the slash merges with the bell rather than cutting a channel through
// it. bell-slash measures identically, to the pixel, for the same reason.
//
// That is more than "visible only on inspection", and it is still the accepted trade because
// it buys a slash that actually draws. If it ever needs closing, the untried route is a mask
// over the WHOLE geometry with the cut following the stroke: both failures recorded above were
// on the SOURCE geometry, where the source's own slash defeats them, and neither objection
// applies once the geometry carries no slash of its own.
//
// EVERY NUMBER IS MEASURED OFF THE PATH.
//   · the slash is a 16-wide round-capped stroke whose caps centre on (48,40) and (208,216),
//     read off the two cap arcs in the source, and is 237.9 units long;
//   · the bell is bell-simple: dome r=80 about (128,104), so it hangs from its crown
//     (128,24), collar straight across at y=200, bar at x88..168 y216..232;
//   · the bar travels 17 — the shipped bell's 4.99° angular swing at this bar's radius — and
//     at full travel its right edge reaches 185, clear of the slash band's near edge at 200,
//     so the two never collide.
